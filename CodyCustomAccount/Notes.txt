Notes:
- SqlQuery will not work with integrated security
- Remember to register NLog with dependency injection before SqlQuery

Advice:
- Why not use Entity Framework? Or give option to use EF?

Challenges:
- I changed up the code in SqlQuery so that instead of using AppConfig, it uses a hardcoded connection string. I did this because I am unfamiliar with AppConfig and didn't
want to waste time. To be fixed in the future.
- It was a extremelly steep learning curve for me, personally. I think this is because I had never used Autofac or Owin.
- To construct the new project, I had strayed off the path of using Owin like in your original projects. I used Microsoft's built in pipeline instead.
- I learned how to use Autofac and was able to implement that in for dependency injection
- Once I got over all the little roadblocks (like using SqlQuery to access the database, and learning the dependencies) the concept was straight forward and easy to use

Overall, as I said before, once you get over the pretty steep learning curve, it is extremelly easy and efficient to use the Command Handler Pattern framework.
I could definetly see myself using this framework in multiple different scenarios.
