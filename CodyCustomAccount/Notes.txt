Notes:
- SqlQuery will not work with integrated security
- Remember to register NLog with dependency injection before SqlQuery


Advice:
- Why not use Entity Framework? Or give option to use EF?

Info:
- I changed up the code in SqlQuery so that instead of using AppConfig, it uses a hardcoded connection string. I did this because I am unfamiliar with AppConfig and didn't
want to waste time. To be fixed in the future.
